# A_Simple_Book_Library
Object oriented program which organizes data based on user search parameters

The program will continue to run until the user enters "q" for termination.
The program allows users to input search parameters such as year range, author, or display books based on category.
The library of books was hard coded in but the code can be mondified to accept a text file or database as long as
the data is entered is formated as title, author name, publisher, date, and genre.
